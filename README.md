- I like to play music
- I like to lift weights
- I like to play video games

## Technical Background
- Despite learning Java in classes, individually I have played around with python, c#, and c
- I am very interested in developing games and have experience designing/programming in Unity
- I also have an interest in cybersecurity and pentesting; I've played around with virtual machines and getting into them using the tools on Kali Linux. The first time I did this was when I was able to take complete control over a Windows XP virtual machine, and had access to all input, including cameras (not impressive since windows XP is so vulnerable, but still fun)
